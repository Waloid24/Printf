# Printf
Hello everyone :wave:! This is my own implementation of the printf function, written in the assembler language on the x86-64 architecture. It largely mimics the operation of the standard printf function.

Supports:
* `%d` - decimal representation of a number
* `%b` - binary representation of a number
* `%x` - hexadecimal representation of a number
* `%c` - character output in ASCII notation
* `%s` - line output
* `%%` - percentage withdrawal
